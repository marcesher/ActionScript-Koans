# ActionScript Koans -- learning ActionScript through FlexUnit tests

These koans draw inspiration initially from David Laing's [JavaScript Koans](https://raw.github.com/mrdavidlaing/javascript-koans), which are based on Edgecase's [Ruby koans](http://github.com/edgecase/ruby_koans)

The koans aim to teach you ActionScript, along with FlexUnit, by getting tests from red to green.

The content of the tests is structured, and largely derived (read: shamelessly ripped off) from [Michelle Yaiser's](http://michelleyaiser.com) fantastic [ActionScript documentation](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/actionscript/learning.html)

I'm writing these Koans to teach myself ActionScript. I want to learn deep. I hope they help you, too.
